# The WebLISP Language Specification

The WebLISP language specification repository contains the formal specification of the WebLISP programming language. This specification defines the syntax, semantics, and features of the language. It will provide a clear understanding of how the language works and what developers can expect from it. The repository will be the central source of truth for the language and will be used by developers to implement WebLISP compilers and interpreters. It will also be used to ensure that all WebLISP implementations are compatible with each other.

## TODO
- [ ] Define the basic syntax of the language, including keywords, literals, and operators.
- [ ] Specify the semantics of the language, including the rules for variable binding, scoping, and control flow.
- [ ] Describe the built-in types and functions of the language.
- [ ] Document the macro system and other advanced language features.
- [ ] Include examples of valid code and expected behavior.
