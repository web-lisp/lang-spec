# WebLISP Language Specification
This repository will contain the formal specification for the WebLISP programming language. The specification provides a detailed description of the syntax, semantics, and features of the language.

The specification is intended to serve as a reference for developers, language implementers, and users of the language. It is an evolving document and will be updated as the language develops.

## TODO
- [ ] Define the basic syntax of the language, including keywords, literals, and operators.
- [ ] Specify the semantics of the language, including the rules for variable binding, scoping, and control flow.
- [ ] Describe the built-in types and functions of the language.
- [ ] Document the macro system and other advanced language features.
- [ ] Include examples of valid code and expected behavior.

## Contributing
Contributions to the WebLISP language specification are welcome. If you notice any errors, omissions, or have suggestions for improvement, please submit an issue or pull request.
